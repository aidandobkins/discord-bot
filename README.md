# discord-bot

This is a discord bot built in python for my friends and I.

It has various useful and funny/fun commands to use, such as:
!laff which pulls a random post from the hot posts today on r/laffjokes,
!lance which posts a random picture of one of our friends as a joke
!doge which pulls the current price of dogecoin
!rank (name) which pulls the league of legends rank of the given player
!play (youtube link) which has the bot join the channel of the user and play the audio of the given link

and more.

The bot also automatically checks for how close peoples birthdays are every 24 hours, and on significant days, will send an appropriate message, such as "in 6 days it is Aidan's birthday

It utilizes multiple APIs and files that are not included so as to keep privacy and tokens safe.

File dependencies are:

birthdays.json
api.txt
lance.txt
token.txt
